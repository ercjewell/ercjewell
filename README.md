<h3 align="center"> Information Professional | Web Developer</h3>
<p>I am an influencer and innovator when it comes to bringing new ideas to challenge the status quo.

I am an Information Science professional with over a decade of experience in planning and implementing programs, community engagement & development, technological innovation, information literacy, and research.

As a front and backend web developer, I create, manage, and maintain websites for the company’s clients. This includes data management, analysis, integration and security, search engine optimization (SEO), information architecture enhancement and navigation, UX/UI research, and human-computer interaction.

Research and technology also drive me to keep pursuing new things. In 2020, I founded Lib3, a Web3 startup that provides Blockchain-powered marketplace and publishing services for professionals in the cycle of academic publishing to combat systems of inequitable pay in academia.</p>
